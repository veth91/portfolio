This portfolio site was designed and crafted by Brandon Veth.

It uses Flexbox for the layout. And media queries for mobile.

I chose JQuery for the display animations because I am familiar with it and it has wide support. 

The design is my own. I wanted something that is minimalist and really directs the readers attention to each piece of content that is presented. 

What I would change: I would use an organizational strategy for the CSS and I would like to incorporate CSS variables for the colors on portfolio buttons and a few other items.

The divs could also be re-factored in a smaller way. I think there are a few items that might be unnecessarily nested in divs. 

Finally, I would rename some of the classes to make more sense.
